## General info
This project contains code for some of the most know types of GAN (Generative Adverserial Network).
I am using this repo to play with these types of networks to get better understanding how they work and how to properly train them.

Disclaimer: This repository is more like proof of concept than download and run!

## Content
```
DCGAN - GAN for generating new images from latent vector
WGAN(GC) - GAN for generating new images from latent vector
SRGAN - GAN for upscaling images
```

## Project Folder Structure
```
- datasets (place for all data that you will want feed to network)
- media (folder with media files of repo)
- modules
    - gans (trainers for all GANs are pleced)
    - keras_extensions (extesions based on keras functionality)
    - models (models and building blocks for models)
    - utils (other helper stuff)
- settings (settings for scripts)
- utility_scripts (scripts for data processing and other useful stuff)
```

## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
```
- Python3.7
- Tensorflow 2.2

For GPU acceleration:
    - Cuda Toolkit 10.1
    - cuDNN for toolkit version
```

## Usage
```
Adjust settings in settings/****_settings.py
Get datasets and place them in dataset directory (Or in directory you set in settings.py)
python preprocess_dataset.py
python train_****.py

After training use
1) python generate_images.py for DCGAN and WGAN
2) python upscale_images.py for SRGAN
(These scripts still needs tweaking because settings for them are hardcoded in them)

Note: These scripts are still in progress of making, some of them may not work!
```

## Utility
```
preprocess_dataset.py - Script for mass rescaling images to target size and optionaly splitting them to training and testing parts
visualize_conv_activations.py - Script for displaying activation of each conv layer as image
show_vgg_structure.py - Script that will print all layers of vgg19 usable for perceptual loss
parse_hr_image.py - Script to parse large images to small ones (WIP)
Note: Some utility scripts have its settings in settings folder
```

## Results
##### SRGAN Results - (Upscaled by opencv, Original, Upscaled by SRGAN)
1) Model without using bias (batch normalization "bias" is used instead) and without using spectral normalization \
1 400 000 episodes
![SRGAN_image_1](media/srgan_results/srganResultImage1.png?raw=true)
2) Model using bias and spectral normalization \
2 500 000 episodes
![SRGAN_image_2](media/srgan_results/srganResultImage2.png?raw=true)

## Used models
```
    Generator / Discriminator (Critic)
1. mod_srgan_exp / mod_base_9layers
2. mod_srgan_exp_sn / mod_base_9layers_sn
```

## TODO
- [x] Implement DCGAN
- [x] Implement WGAN
- [x] Implement SRGAN
- [ ] Implement StyleGAN
- [x] Implement custom Tensorboard for logging stats
- [x] Implement learning rate scheduler
- [x] Implement spectral normalization layer
- [x] Test Charbonnier loss instead of MSE loss in SRGAN
- [ ] Test Huber loss instead of MSE loss in SRGAN
- [x] Test MAE loss instead of MSE loss in SRGAN
- [ ] Test impact of different weights of losses in SRGAN
- [x] Optimize training loop of SRGAN (Too much time is spending of testing performance)
- [x] Implement custom batch maker
- [ ] Optimize batch maker to use generator class from keras
- [x] Optimize preprocessing dataset (Too slow)
- [x] Optimize interface scripts with more acessible settings
- [ ] Retrain all SRGAN models with single test image with same train settings to properly compare them
- [ ] Implement gradient accumulation to "simulate" larger batch

## Current tasks
```
- Testing best working model pairs for WGAN
- Refactoring
- Retraining all SRGAN models
```

## Notes
Testing of Charbonnier loss for SRGAN failed because the values were too different from MSE loss values, maybe more tweaking required and test again. \
MAE loss is causing lot of artifacts and image distortions (like color shifting, "image bleedoff", etc) in results from SRGAN. \
SRGAN will be trained only on face images, bacause I am not able to balance enough dataset (You can compensate it in some minor way by introducing labels to generator)

## Testing setup
```
Hardware:
    Processor: I7-9700KF 4.8GHz
    RAM: HyperX Fury RGB 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 3200MHz
    GPU: GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8G
    SSD: Intel 660p M.2 2TB SSD NVMe

Editor: PyCharm (always latest version)
```

### Some resources might be missing, I started researching this topic long before this repository was created!
